My name is Juliano Pereira Lima. I'm a Computer Scientist and I've been working as Software Developer since 2016 working with Frontend and Backend. 

Currently I'm Software Engineer at [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br/en/) using Clojure and a lot of cool stuff. 

I'm passionate about technology, Computer Science, Software Engineering, agile and how it changes the world every second, `empowering people and making their lives better.`

Currently, I'm focusing on learning Clojure, Functional Programming and Operations(*Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, AWS*) but I still enjoy programming with Javascript(Especially in **React** applications) and .NET Core(**C#**).
